# rebuild
Another programming tool created using modern c++ and other tools

Goals
------

- Code shouldn't be written.. Ever. We should build it and and rebuild if required; Its a continuous / incremental process.
- Break vicious cycle of edit, compile, run, test, debug and edit again.

Achivements
------
- Its turing complete!
- Code is not written, its stored and loaded via json formated AST.
- A linenoise based repl helps it to rebuild.


Running
------
- MacOSX/Xcode is only development platform for now.
